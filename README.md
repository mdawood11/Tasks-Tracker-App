## AS AN employee with a busy schedule I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.


1-GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

2-WHEN I open the planner

3-THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

4-WHEN I scroll down

5-THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

6-WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

7-THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

8-WHEN I click into a time block

9-THEN I can enter an event

10-WHEN I click the save button for that time block

11-THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

12-WHEN I refresh the page

13-THEN the saved events persist
